DESIGN ALCHEMY

The fundamentals of good design are eternal. Innovation is essential. We balance rigorous design with an openness to experimentation in our mission to create products that enrich your life. The creation of an excellent product is not a matter of simple fabrication. Our long heritage of master craftsmanship, from the materials we select to how we craft each product, imbues everything we make with precision and feeling.

Produced in the Eu, this limited edition lounger is suitable for events, clubs, airlines, hotels, workplaces and indulgence-seeking individuals. Available from February 2018

### Experience

Sounds Like Home

There’s this feeling. It’s like your favorite song; like home. Maybe it’s hard to explain, but you know it. It’s when everything is in sync and you are free to decompress, create, design, entertain. It’s that atmosphere created when every element comes together in perfect harmony. When it comes to composing a home, people explore design differently to curate their space. And the beauty of that freedom is that there is more than one correct answer. As long as you pick elements that make you feel at home, you’re on the right track. Maybe it’s a lamp, or a chair. Maybe even a plant, or the music playing in the background. These things aren’t just there by chance - they mean something.
